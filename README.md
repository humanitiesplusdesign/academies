Richelieu Membership Schema
=========

Short Name: Richelieu

Creation Date: July 2013

Sources: 

Description: Richelieu was developed to systematized membership data from European literary and scientific academies of the early modern and modern periods. It records election and departure dates from particular academies for individual members as events. Richelieu can be used to organize data for academies and clubs with accurate and precise membership data. It is not appropriate for academies that do not keep full membership lists or dates of election or departures. Biographical data for members are not included.

**Description:** (This is the narrative part that explains the purpose and context of this schema. If, for example, you expect this schema to be extended -- to include other academies, for example -- go ahead and line that up.)

**Vocabulary:**  (This should be term + description. This defines your controlled vocabulary so that others know how you arrived at it. For academies, this should be straightforward, but necessary documentation, nonetheless.)

Authors: Melanie Conroy, Nicole DeBenedictis
